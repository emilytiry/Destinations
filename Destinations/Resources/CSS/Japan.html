    <p>Mostly known for the famous Kyoto Protocol, Kyoto also surprises with its quiet temples, colorful shrines and sublime gardens. You can hear 
        the ‘nightingale floors’ squeak beneath your feet at Nijō-jō, sip matcha in pristine tearooms, drink beer on the banks of the Kamo-gama or 
        cycle through Arashiyama’s bamboo forest.</p>

    <p>Japan is located in Asia along with China.</p>

    <img src="/Volumes/Student-Files/2018-19/Emily.Tiry/Destinations/Resources/Images/Japan/Nara 1.jpg" alt="Nara 1.jpg" width=300px length=300px>
    <p>Nara is the capital of Japan’s Nara Prefecture, in south-central Honshu. The city has significant temples and artwork dating to the 8th 
        century, when it was Japan’s capital. Deer roam in Nara Park, site of Tōdai-ji temple. Daibutsu, Tōdai-ji's 15m-high bronze Buddha, is 
        displayed in a large wooden hall. On the park's east side is the Shinto shrine Kasuga Taisha, which dates to 768 A.D. and more than 
        3,000 lanterns.</p>

    <p>Tokyo is a well-known city, but is officially known as a “metropolitan prefecture”, which differs from and combines elements of both a city 
        and a prefecture, a characteristic unique to Tokyo. Formerly known as Edo, Tokyo is frequently the setting for many Japanese movies, 
        television shows, animated series (anime), web comics, and comic books (manga).</p>
