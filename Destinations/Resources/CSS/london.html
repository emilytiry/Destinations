    <p>Several bridges named London Bridge have spanned the River Thames between the City of London and Southwark, in central London. The current crossing, 
        which opened to traffic in 1973, is a box girder bridge built from concrete and steel.</p>

    <p> The Clock tower also goes by the name of Big Ben. Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in 
        London and is usually extended to refer to both the clock and the clock tower.</p>

    <p>The Westminster is the bustling government area near Buckingham Palace. Tourists head to Trafalgar Square’s monuments and the guard change at 
        Horse Guards Parade. Politicians mingle in Whitehall’s busy pubs. At the Houses of Parliament, alongside the River Thames, the bell of Big Ben rings in 
        its iconic clock tower. Medieval Westminster Abbey contains the graves of historical figures such as Charles Darwin.</p>

    <p>The beautiful city of London is the capital of England and the United Kingdom, is a 21st-century city with history stretching back to 
        Roman times. At its centre stand the imposing Houses of Parliament, the iconic ‘Big Ben’ clock tower and Westminster Abbey, site of British 
        monarch coronations. Across the Thames River, the London Eye observation wheel provides panoramic views of the South Bank cultural complex, 
        and the entire city.</p>
