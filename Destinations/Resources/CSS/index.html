    <h1>Bali
    <br>
        Om Suastiastu!
    </h1>
    <h2>Bail is an amazing place to go to if you like beaches.</h2>
    <h3>
        <img src="/Volumes/Student-Files/2018-19/Emily.Tiry/Destinations/Resources/Images/Bali/beaches1.jpg" alt="beaches1.jpg" width=300px length=300px>
        <p>Bali has a rich assortment of beaches, each of which is a favorite destination on its own. Bali beaches range from palm-fringed white sand 
            coasts on the island’s south such as Kuta, Nusa Dua and Sanur, to the cliff-guarded ‘hidden’ shores of Uluwatu, Padang Padang, Dreamland and Bingin. 
            Bali beaches also comprise striking black sands on the north and western shorelines, with sleepy undisturbed coves in-between. Once the haunt of surfers, 
            Bali's beaches now welcome visitors in search of paradise with superb hotels and excellent facilities.</p>

        <p>The Besakih Temple, known as Bali’s ‘Mother Temple’ for over 1,000 years, sits 1,000 metres high on the southwestern slopes of Mount Agung. 
            Besakih is an artistic and unique complex that comprises at least 86 temples which include the main Pura Penataran Agung (the Great Temple 
            of State) and 18 others.</p>

        <p> Bali is located in Indonesia.</p>

        <p> Uluwatu is not just a spiritual place of mystical proportions, it is also home to an impressive population of crab-eating macaques. 
            Prepare to see some serious monkey business with these mischievous primates. Admittedly, they’re adorable and entertaining, but be aware! 
            They are also incredible cunning. Remember to keep an eye on your smartphone when you’re taking snapshots of those beautiful views..</p>
